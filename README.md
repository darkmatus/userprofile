Userprofile for own website project(s)
======================================

Install:
- clone 
- create 'public/images/user_uploads' and make it writeable
- insert 'scripts/sql/userprofile.sql' into your database

I hope that this is all. If i forgott some thing it will be added.
Please believe, this zf2-module is for use with my own projects and it is still under development.
If you use it and find errors, please contact me with your bug fix.


This module is prepared to uses jquery-custom-ui-1.10 for output.
